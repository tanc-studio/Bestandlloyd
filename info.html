                             <p class="text">Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
                                Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as your name,
                                email address or information about what you like and do not like. It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.</p>

                             <p class="text">Best & Lloyd collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information
                                to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their
                                date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us. Another example of Best & Lloyd collecting anonymous information is when web site users
                                are invited to respond to surveys on a Best & Lloyd website. The surveys may ask you for demographic information such as your age,
                                gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible),
                                and remains anonymous. Many of the individuals who access our services are anonymous to us.</p>

                             <p class="text">The second type of information that Best & Lloyd collects is personal information. Best & Lloyd will collect personal information that
                                lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address, when you provide it to us.
                                With this information, Best & Lloyd can provide a variety of personalised and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users.
                                We hope that you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more
                                valuable to you.</p>

                             <p class="text">Sometimes we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service.
                                Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer,
                                credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of
                                additional products and services which may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information when you are undertaking
                                product or service registration on our website. We may also ask about your interests, but it is your choice whether to respond.
                                How much of your personal information that you choose to disclose to Best & Lloyd is completely up to you. The only way we know
                                something about you personally is if you provide it to us, for example when you take part in a discussion forum or enter one of
                                the competitions on our websites.</p>
