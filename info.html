                     <p>Best & Lloyd is committed to protecting your privacy while using with our content, products and services.
                        We want to provide a safe and secure environment for you and your dependants.</p>

                     <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you visit our website,
                        how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your
                        ability to correct this information. Our policy allows you to choose what kind and how much information you provide to us
                        and to control how we use whatever information you give us. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing
                        you to control your privacy and to give you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.</p>

                     <p>This policy applies only to Best & Lloyd and not to other companies' or organisations' websites to which Best & Lloyd is linked.</p>

                  <!-- Collection of Information -->
                  <section class="section">
                     <h4>19. Collection of Information</h4>
                     <p>Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
                        Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as your name,
                        email address or information about what you like and do not like. It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.</p>

                     <p>Best & Lloyd collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information
                        to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their
                        date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us. Another example of Best & Lloyd collecting anonymous information is when web site users
                        are invited to respond to surveys on a Best & Lloyd website. The surveys may ask you for demographic information such as your age,
                        gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible),
                        and remains anonymous. Many of the individuals who access our services are anonymous to us.</p>

                     <p>The second type of information that Best & Lloyd collects is personal information. Best & Lloyd will collect personal information that
                        lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address, when you provide it to us.
                        With this information, Best & Lloyd can provide a variety of personalised and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users.
                        We hope that you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more
                        valuable to you.</p>

                     <p>Sometimes we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service.
                        Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer,
                        credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of
                        additional products and services which may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information when you are undertaking
                        product or service registration on our website. We may also ask about your interests, but it is your choice whether to respond.
                        How much of your personal information that you choose to disclose to Best & Lloyd is completely up to you. The only way we know
                        something about you personally is if you provide it to us, for example when you take part in a discussion forum or enter one of
                        the competitions on our websites.</p>

                     <h4>20. Use of Anonymous Information</h4>
                     <p>Best & Lloyd automatically gathers anonymous information to monitor the use of www.bestandlloyd.com like the numbers and frequency of
                        visitors to www.bestandlloyd.com and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.
                        We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site,
                        so we can improve www.bestandlloyd.com to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many users as possible.

                        <section class="section">
                           <h4>Brass</h4>
                           <p>Brass is an incredibly durable material which will last for hundreds of years in a good state if it is looked after.
                              We do not lacquer the majority of our brass finishes, we chemically age the brass and then apply a pure beeswax so that it has the charm and depth of finish
                              only usually gained over many years.</p>

                           <p>Our Antique Brass finish should not be polished with abrasive metal cleaners as this will take away the character built up
                              by our craftsman's aging process. The patina on the surface of antique brass continues to build up and mature over many years, so adding to its beauty.
                              If however at any time you wish to brighten the finish or remove any unsightly marks we would recommend a light waxing using very fine wire wool
                              (0000 grade) which will gently clean the surface if needed. Dip the wire wool into a pure beeswax and very lightly rub the surface in a circular
                              motion but be careful not to over polish. After cleaning gently buff the surface with a soft cotton cloth. A further waxing and gentle buffing using
                              just a cotton cloth will help build up a surface protection if desired. Regular dusting should be enough to keep them bright but not over shiny.</p>

                           <h4>Gilt and Bronze</h4>
                           <p>Gilt and Bronze finishes, by their nature, are delicate and should not be cleaned too vigorously. Do not use any chemicals,
                              cleaners or anything abrasive as it may damage the finish. Excessive handling should be avoided as the acid in fingertips can lead to surface damage.
                              It is advisable to only clean the surface by dusting gently with a soft brush or a cotton cloth. If required, a very light application and buffing with a
                              pure beeswax using only a soft cotton cloth can also help protect the finish.</p>

                           <h4>Nickel Chrome & Gold Plate</h4>
                           <p>It is advisable to only clean the surface by dusting gently with a soft brush or a cotton cloth
                              Specific product care instructions will be provided with your order.</p>
