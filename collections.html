            <h2>Mirrors & Tables</h2>
            <p>Designed by British artist Anthony Critchlow, the mirrors and consoles encapsulate
            his playful use of circles and spheres with symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes.
            Made from stainless steel, these pieces can be finished to any colour using PVD coatings.
            They are available in Polished Nickel & Warm Gold as standard.</p>

            <h2>Plaza & Beluga</h2>
            <p>Designed by British artist Anthony Critchlow, the plaza and beluga ranges are more
            symmetrical and formal and are a modern nod to the elegance of the 1920’s.

            to any size and available on timeless polished nickel and warm gold as standard.</p>

            <h2>Anenome</h2>
            <p>The Anenome series of table lamps and sculptural spheres were designed for Best & Lloyd
            by Anthony Crithlow, a British sculptor, artist and drummer. Each piece is lit internally and on top
            and throws light and reflections across the walls and surfaces. Available in three standard sizes,
            the lamps can also be scaled to order.</p>

         <section class="section">
            <h2>Seapod</h2>
            <p>The Seapod series of sconces were designed for Best & Lloyd by Anthony Crithlow,
            a British sculptor, artist and drummer. Each combines symmetry of form with an asymmetrical structure,
            throwing elegant light patterns across wall and surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Faceted</h2>
            <p>The Jewel & Gem collections represent a collaboration between Best & Lloyd & Bohemian Glass cutters to support
            a skill that was dying out in the region and to encourage the young to come into the ageing craft.
            The shapes echo gem stones with colours to match. A Large vase blank can weigh 15kg before cutting begins
            and take up to 2 hours to blow and 20 hours to cut. Glass colour rod is used initially and then the weight is
            built up layer by layer of molten clear glass until it reaches its pre-cut size, around double its final weight.</p>

         <section class="section">
            <h2>Ring</h2>
            <p>The ring glass is made using a complicated technique called cane work. First a large pickup of molten glass is taken
            from the furnace and drawn out to create a thick long piece of glass. This is then reheated and curved around a tool
            of the correct diameter before being cut and the 2 ends joined white still hot. Each is unique and the metal work
            designed according to the ring received.</p>

            <h2>Chelsea</h2>
            <p>Canework and handblown tubes are amongst the hardest glass blowing techniques.
            The glass is pulled through a profiled tool either dropped as the blower pulls or else a lift is used.
            The skill is to stop the tube falling in on itself as it is pulled. Most tube work is mould blown with very
            few glassblowers left who can work the glassine of whom is English glass artist Stewart Hearn.
            The chelsea range features several sizes of tube including ribbed and twisted profiles. Each can be blown in any colour.</p>
